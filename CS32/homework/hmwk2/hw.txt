Given the algorithm in mazestack.cpp, the first 12 (r, c) from the main function would be:
(3, 4)
(3, 3)
(3, 5)
(2, 5)
(1, 5)
(1, 6)
(1, 7)
(1, 8)
(2, 8)
(3, 6)
(4, 4)
(5, 4)

Given the algorithm in mazequeue.cpp, the first 12 (r, c) from the main function would be:
(3, 4)
(4, 4)
(3, 5)
(3, 3)
(5, 4)
(3, 6)
(2, 5)
(6, 4)
(5, 5)
(1, 5)
(7, 4)
(5, 6)


The first algorithm in mazestack.cpp uses a stack data structure. This data structure works by adding the point class on top of the data structure and when we pop it, it takes the item from the top. This differs from mazequeue.cpp, which uses a queue data structure. This data structure works by adding the point class on the top of the data structure and when we pop it, we take it from the beginning of the data structure, not the end.
